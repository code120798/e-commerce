Shamsuls Online Portfolio

It allows the user to get in touch with ease, is visually pleasing and is accessibility friendly for the visually impaired. 

UDX

This project is completely responsive on both a desktop and mobile.

Added UDX features following writing my UDX files:

I have hidden the nav bar on all pages when the view is on mobile as it would take up too much space, instead i have created a drop down menu

Features:

Feature 1
– fixed nav on desktop --- ease of navigation

Feature 2
– Large font --- ease of navigation

Feature 3
– Forms are not yet fully functional

Feature 4
– hyperlinks on accreditation logos link to official page --- gives user more reviews and increases trust.


Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Git
Github
VS Code
Google Chrome Developer tools

Testing:
- Nav Bar

Does the Nav Bar drop downs on 'About' and 'Gallery' work smoothly and align with the sites design?

Does the Nav Bar toggle work smoothly when looking at the site from Tablet view and smaller?

When using the Nav Bar toggle, and clicking on the 'About' and 'Gallery' dropdowns, does it push the other content down so you can still see the other page options?

Does the 'Request a free survey' button, take you to the 'Contact us' page?

Homepage external hyperlinks on photos

When clicking on the 'Which Best Buy' photo, does it open up a new window with the website, directly taking you to the Southwick's page on their site?

When clicking on the 'Buy with Confidence' photo, does it open up a new window with the website, directly taking you to the Southwick's page on their site?

Deployment

This website was creating using VS Code, a local git directory was used for version control, and then uploaded to GitHub. I have made it live using Git pages. To do this I initiated the git repository with 'git innit', then used 'git status' to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository. I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit my changed files to the repository. Once my files were committed I used 'git push' to push all my new and changed files to GitHub before making it live with Git pages. I did this every time I made major changes to any part of my site.
